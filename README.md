## Installation

Node.js, Inquirer, console.table and mysql2 are required to use this tool. If you dont have either of those, you will have to install them first.

## Usage

First, download the dependencies by running "npm install", next go into mysql shell and import the schema files by running "source schema.sql" and then exit the shell. Run "npm run seed" in the terminal and next go to the command line in the folder that holds your server.js file. Finally, type "node server.js" and click enter. Go to Insomnia and test out the routes yourself to see how it works!
